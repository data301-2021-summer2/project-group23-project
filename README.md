## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

{I will be comparing and analyzing the financial data of TSLA and SPY. The variables that I plan on analyzing include: Date, Open, Close and Volume. 
Potential questions I plan on answering are: 
"Daygain analysis from TSLA/SPY", 
"Analysis of volume increase/decrease SPY/TSLA - is there any correlations?", 
"Differences in volume/share price by date for SPY/TSLA"
As a management student, I am interested in finance, so that is why I have chosen this topic.}

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

{I have two data sets. One is daily TSLA stock data from 2010-2020, the other is daily SPY stock data from 1993-2020. Each set has 7 columns. The TSLA data set has roughly ~3650 rows and the SPY data set has roughly ~9855. I narrowed the focus to 2010-2020. The data is from kaggle, but the kaggle users used yahoofinance for the data.}
