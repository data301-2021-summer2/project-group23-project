## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

{I will be comparing and analyzing the financial data of TSLA and SPY. The variables that I plan on analyzing include: Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Adj. Close, and Volume. Potential questions I plan on answering are: "Would you have had a better return from TSLA or SPY over a 1/5/10 year period, and if so what years?", 
"Analysis of volume increase/decrease SPY/TSLA", 
"Differences in volatility between the two share prices/volume." 
As a management student, I am interested in finance, so that is why I have chosen this topic.}

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

{I have two data sets. One is daily TSLA stock data from 2010-2020, the other is daily SPY stock data from 1993-2020. Each set has 7 columns. The TSLA data set has roughly ~3650 rows and the SPY data set has roughly ~9855. I will likely narrow the focus to certain timeframes/questions in the coming weeks as I learn more about how to clean and process the data. }
